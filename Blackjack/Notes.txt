We are working on the New features.
[Betpanel has been collapsed]
 BUGS:
  
 NOTES:
 - We might try to merge "int Playerhand" and "int[] PlayerHandValue"
 --> So we remove the int and only keep the list.
	 The list already contains all the values of the cards that we posses. We can just use a sum to get the total value of a deck.
	 ==> Replacing [PlayerHand] with [PlayerHandValue.Sum()];
	 ISSUE SOLVED :)

 - We can try to remove CardName and just use the last item in playerhand.
	==> NO
